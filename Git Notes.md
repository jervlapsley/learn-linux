Git is a version control system. Used to store, track and manage code and files

#### Intro
- `git init`  - initializes the current directory, converting to a git repo
	- `git init <repo-name>` - creates a new git repo with a name
- `git add` - adds files/changes to the staging area
	- `. OR --all` adds all files to the staging area
- `git commit` - saves (or commits) a file to the repo

	- >[!TIP]
	  >it is recommended that present tense is used and keep it consistent throughout a project
	- `-m` adds a commit message 
- `git status` - shows status of the staging and working area
